## Deployment
Just push to main branch, and github actions will take care of the rest.

## Customizing

You can edit `_config.yml` file to customize your blog. You can change things such as the name of the blog, the author, the appearance of the theme (light, dark or auto), how dates are formatted, etc. Customizable fields should be straightforward to understand. Still, `_config.yml` contains some comments to help you understand what each field does.

For further customization (e.g. layout, CSS) see the [official Jekyll's documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) on customizing gem-based themes.

### Customize the menu

In order to add/edit/delete entries in the home page, you can copy the `home.yml` file inside `_data` folder. Through that file you can define the structure of the menu and add data for navbar, footer, portfolio or simply remove all of that and use simple blog layout. Take a look at the default configuration to get an idea of how it works and read on for a more comprehensive explaination.

The `home.yml` file accepts the following fields:

1. Vertical list
  - `entries` define a new unordered list that will contain menu entries
  - each entry is marked by a `-` at the beginning of the line
  - each entry has the following attributes:
    - `title`, which defines the text to render for that menu entry
    - `url`, which can either be a URL or `false`. If it is `false`, the entry will be rendered as plain text; otherwise the entry will be rendered as a link pointing to the specified URL. Note that the URL can either be relative or absolute.
    - `post_list`, which can be `true` or `false`. If it is true, the entry will have all posts in the site as subentries. This is used to render your post list.
    - `entries`, yes, you can have entries inside entries. In this way you can create nested sublists!
2. Card list - cards are used to showcase portfolio projects. Please see `project_entries` in `_data/home.yml` file
  - each entry is marked by a `-` at the beginning of the line
  - each entry has the following attributes:
    - `title` defines the header of the card
    - `desc` is the body of the card
    - `url` is a relative or absolute link which this card can point to.
    - `highlight` in case you want to highlight something, keep the text short though
3. Horizontal list - moonwalk uses horizontal lists to create navbar and footer. Please see `navbar_entries` and `footer_entries` in `data/home.yml` file
  - each entry is marked by a `-` at the beginning of the line
  - each entry has the following attributes:
    - `title` defines the header of the card
    - `url` is a relative or absolute link which this card can point to.


### Pro tips
1. Moonwalk has 3 in-built layouts:
  - post - for content
  - blog - for listing blog posts
  - home - for landing page
  you can change your `index.md` file to use either home or blog layout.

2. It is extremely easy to tweak the color scheme. 
  - for light mode, customize these css variables
```css
html {
    --bg: #fff;
    --bg-secondary: #f3f4f6;
    --headings: #1e293b;
    --text: #374151;
    --text-secondary: #6b7280;
    --links: #6366f1;
    --highlight: #ffecb2; // light yellow
    --code-text: #9d174d;
}
```
  - for dark mode customize these css variables
```css
@mixin dark-appearance {
  html, body  {
      --headings: #74c0fc;
      --links: #91a7ff;
      --highlight: #41c7c7;
      --bg: #1f242a;
      --bg-secondary: #323945;
      --text: #adb5bd;
      --text-secondary: #9ca3af;
      --code-text: #91a7ff;
  };
}
```

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `moonwalk.gemspec` accordingly.
